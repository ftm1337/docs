# ðŸ”“ Lockless Protocol
Liquid-Staking Protocol for unlocking the potential of locked assets!

## Introduction
SW-Tokens are liquid wrappers for the locked assets. They can be employed to earn a yield without compromising on the opportunity cost of locking the asset.

## Deployments
Lockless Protocol is active on the following assets:

### mFTM

- FTM - The Native Fantom Opera Chain Coin

### SWKAVA

- KAVA - The Native Kava Chain Coin

### SWECH

- ECH - The Native Echelon Chain Coin

### SWCANTO

- CANTO - The Native Canto Chain Coin

Each deployment has it's own unique features!

## Security
- Minting of SW-Tokens is handled by a Smart Contract, which allows minting only **after** receiving an equivalent amount of Base asset.
- All the staked assets are partitioned into Vaults that put a cap on how many assets are held together.
- Once the Base Asset is deposited, it gets permanently locked into the Base Protocol.
