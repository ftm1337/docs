# ðŸŒ‰ $fBOMB token

{ .highlight }
fBOMB is not based on ElitenessOFT standard, but is deployed on newer chains as a clone of existing fBOMB v3 contracts written by MaxFlowO2. Despite the difference, fBOMB is still compatible through a custom adaptor with ElitenessOFT Bridge.

{ .highlight }
fBOMB has undergone 3 token migrations since its launch in January 2021. The rest of this article deals with the current (3rd) version only.
