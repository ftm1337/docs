# Benefits to Ramses.Exchange ecosystem
There are quite a few things that Guru Network brings to the table:

## Permanent Bribes
The ELR protocol has a dedicated 80% of it's net yield for Bribing the stakeholders of Ramses DEX - the veRAM holders.

With ELR whitelisted, Ramses will gain a permanent briber who is guaranteed to bribe in each and every epoch, irrespective of the market conditions.

## ELR Volume = ETH paid to Ramses's Voters
Since ELR's core pool is with WETH, the trading volume that takes place will pay the voters with ETH & ELR. And this volume is guaranteed by the Kompound Protocol.

## 'Fair Tokenomics' offering infinite scalability
Unlike generic tokens, the supply of ELR is not controlled by anyone. It can scale as much as THE itself. There are no "team tokens" or "VC Shares" , and  ELR can be minted at will by any THE or veRAM holder, permissionlessly.

## Extending the options for veRAM
ELR opens us the conduit for making the Locked veRAM position liquid again. It also relieves the user from the burden of claiming multiple tokens from bribes & trader-fees and subsidises the gas costs by socializing it.

For new users, it offers a no-commitment exposure to the Ramses Economy. ELR brings purely Real Yield with it, befitting the Solidly approach.

## More liquidity on the Ramses books
ELR/ETH pool will bring in another liquidity pool to Ramses which is guaranteed to generate consistent trade volume, thanks to the iELR Granary.

## The Solidly Experience
Guru Network is the oldest protocol using Solidly. We were the creators of the first solidly gauge on the testnet after Andre & team, and have been quite active in its testing, continuously taking part in improving the Solidly codebase with pulls & its economic model throughout its life & birth. Our token ELITE on Fantom has been participating in the SolidlyWars right from the First Epoch last winter. Today we own nearly 2% of Solidly's circulating supply on Ethereum and have been actively suggesting code improvements to it. We are also the biggest non-partner protocol in it's governance race. We are more equitably involved with the Equalizer exchange, where we helped reshape many of  its facets. Our Solidly Extended Router has been used by multiple Solidly forks & Aggregators to make their ecosystems inclusive to exotic tokens. An alliance with Guru Network greatly benefits Ramses in the long run, as we are not here just for the yields, but for developing & mainting the actual Tech that furthers the Decentralization phenomenon.

## And, Beginning of the Ramses Wars
We are the first protocol in the governance race of Ramses.Exchange outside of the 19 partners. We believe the whitelisting of ELR at  Ramses will encourage a lot more smaller and newer protocols to build unique products atop Ramses and kickstart an era of collaborative building here.
